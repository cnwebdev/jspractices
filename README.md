# JAVASCRIPT PRACTICE

A project to document Javascript Fundamental Concepts and code exercises, the goal of this project is to review all JavaScript core features and document the knowledge learned in short summarized text and follow with code examples.

## Attribution

The learning resourse for this project are from the [W3Schoo](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)l, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and the book title JavaScript The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan (6th Edition).

### Introduction

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. JavaScript is part of the triad of technology that all Web developers must learn: HTML to spefify the content of the web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of the web page, and JavaScript to specify the behavior of the web pages.

### Fundamental

JavaScript is the high-level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming language that is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles.

### A Tour around Core JS Features

```js
// Anything following double slashes is an English comment.
// Comment are english text that explain the JavaScript code.

// A veriable is a symbolic name for a value.
// Variables are declared with the var keyword

var x;   // Declare a variable name x.

// Value can be assinged to a variable with and = sign
x = 5;   // Now variable x has the value 5
x        // => 5: the output of x after evaluates to it value

// JavaScript supports serveral types of values
x = 1;                           // Numbers.
x = 0.01;                        // One Number type for interger and real number.
x = "Hello World";               // Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript';                // String is also work in single  quatation.
x = true;                        // Boolean values.
x = false;                       // The other Boolean value.
x = null;                        // Null is a special value that means "no value".
x = undefined                    // Undefined is liek null.
